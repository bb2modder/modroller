/**
 * A leader managing consensus across remote followers.
 * <p>
 * A leader instance starts up in
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.internal.ketch.KetchLeader.State#CANDIDATE} and tries
 * to begin a new term by sending an
 * {@link ElectionRound} to all replicas. Its
 * term starts if a majority of replicas have accepted this leader instance for
 * the term.
 * <p>
 * Once elected by a majority the instance enters
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.internal.ketch.KetchLeader.State#LEADER} and runs
 * proposals offered to {@link #queueProposal(Proposal)}. This continues until
 * the leader is timed out for inactivity, or is deposed by a competing leader
 * gaining its own majority.
 * <p>
 * Once timed out or deposed this {@code KetchLeader} instance should be
 * discarded, and a new instance takes over.
 * <p>
 * Each leader instance coordinates a group of
 * {@link KetchReplica}s. Replica instances are
 * owned by the leader instance and must be discarded when the leader is
 * discarded.
 * <p>
 * In Ketch all push requests are issued through the leader. The steps are as
 * follows (see {@link KetchPreReceive} for an
 * example):
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a {@link Proposal} with the
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.transport.ReceiveCommand}s that represent the push.
 * <li>Invoke {@link #queueProposal(Proposal)} on the leader instance.
 * <li>Wait for consensus with
 * {@link Proposal#await()}.
 * <li>To examine the status of the push, check
 * {@link Proposal#getCommands()}, looking at
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.internal.storage.reftree.Command#getResult()}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The leader gains consensus by first pushing the needed objects and a
 * {@link RefTree} representing the
 * desired target repository state to the {@code refs/txn/accepted} branch on
 * each of the replicas. Once a majority has succeeded, the leader commits the
 * state by either pushing the {@code refs/txn/accepted} value to
 * {@code refs/txn/committed} (for Ketch-aware replicas) or by pushing updates
 * to {@code refs/heads/master}, etc. for stock Git replicas.
 * <p>
 * Internally, the actual transport to replicas is performed on background
 * threads via the {@link KetchSystem}'s
 * executor service. For performance, the
 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.internal.ketch.KetchLeader},
 * {@link KetchReplica} and
 * {@link Proposal} objects share some state,
 * and may invoke each other's methods on different threads. This access is
 * protected by the leader's {@link #lock} object. Care must be taken to prevent
 * concurrent access by correctly obtaining the leader's lock.
